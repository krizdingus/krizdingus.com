## Behind the Build

This site wasn't designed by committee. It wasn't built for conversion rates. It was built because I didn't like the old one.

A comprehensive writeup about the site's evolution—from a one-page .php file duct-taped to a HostGator coupon, to a glitchy, CRT-themed side project powered by spite and raw HTML—is currently in progress. Stay tuned for the full breakdown of how this site came to be.
